    <!-- FILE SUMMARY -->
    <section class="file-section">
      <h3>FILE SUMMARY — INITIAL OBSERVATION</h3>
      <p>
        This archive contains visual records collected from
        <span class="redact">publicly accessible locations</span>
        during periods of routine movement. No
        <span class="redact">extraordinary access</span>
        was required. No permissions were requested.
        The <span class="redact">environments</span> documented were already marked,
        monitored, and regulated prior to capture.
        Any suggestion that these images expose hidden systems is inaccurate.
        The systems were never hidden.
        <span class="redact">They were only un-observed.</span>

    <!-- FIELD NOTES -->
    <section class="file-section">
      <h3>FIELD NOTES — PATTERN RECOGNITION</h3>
      <p>
        Repeated symbols appear across
        <span class="redact">unrelated districts</span>:
        warnings, prohibitions, surveillance apparatus,
        behavioral instructions. The language is consistent.
        The tone is instructional.
        <span class="redact">Compliance is</span> assumed.
        Resistance is not addressed.
        <span class="redact">Individuals</span> passing through these zones
        rarely acknowledge the signage, despite adjusting their behavior accordingly.
        Awareness is present but not
        <span class="redact">completely focused</span>.
      </p>

    <!-- STATUS REPORT -->
    <section class="file-section">
      <h3>STATUS REPORT — CONTROL MECHANISMS</h3>
      <p>
        Authority within contemporary urban environments rarely
        <span class="redact">presents itself</span> as force.
        It appears as infrastructure: surveillance cameras,
        warning signs, restricted zones, and behavioral instructions
        embedded <span class="redact">into public space</span>.
        <strong>These systems do not demand belief, only compliance.</strong>
        <span class="redact">Observation replaces dialogue.</span>
        Boundaries replace consent.
        The controlling presence is not absent —
        it is <span class="redact">systemic</span>,
        operating through design rather than declaration.
