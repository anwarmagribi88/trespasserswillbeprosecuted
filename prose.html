    <p>
      Nobody told us when the rules changed.
      There was no announcement. No siren.
      Just a quiet shift in what was allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day you speak freely. The next, you learn to pause —
      not because you’re afraid, but because the room feels like it’s listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compliance didn’t arrive with force.
      It arrived with convenience.

    <p>
      Everyone is polite now.
      Excessively polite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Politeness has become a survival strategy.
      A way of signalling that you understand the arrangement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The angriest people don’t shout.
      They whisper. They archive. They wait.

      It isn’t violence that defines this era.
      It’s administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forms. Metrics. Scores.
      Invisible tallies kept somewhere you will never access.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t know what you’re accused of —
      only that appeal is no longer part of the process.

    <p>
      I stopped asking who was watching.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more important question became:
      <em>What version of me are they recording?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      A person can live many lives —
      but the archive only keeps one.
