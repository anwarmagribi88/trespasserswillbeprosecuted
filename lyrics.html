      <h2>Scheme 2 Survive</h2>
      <pre class="lyrics">
Goodbye 9 to 5, am I living to live.
or living blink to blink.

Good morning boss, please pay rise.
Good employee, I am, I cries.

Most of the monies I get from you is just to

Track 12 explains pain and 1996.

Brave New World, ghost girl, cute curls.
Save your pearls, post twirl, flute cowgirl.
